### Summary
2 races in one weekend! Ouch. Besides th TSEpic last year, I haven’t done back to back races since college.

Race 3 for me was the TBF MTB Classic. As with most of the TBF cross country bike races, this took place in Granite Bay on the trails around the western side of lake Fulsom.

For this race, I didn’t have a ton in me after the exhausting day of racing the day before. I tried to put in a good effort out of the gate, but my number plate flipped up immediately since I didn’t tie it down well and I got distracted trying to fix that. While I was trying to fix my plate my ability to jocky for position was compromised and I fell to the back of the pack quickly. It’s not the end of the world on the TBF courses if you’re not exactly at the front at the start, but I ended up going the opposite direction I need to during the opening stretch and it made it pretty hard to work my way back up front.

The race this time around was about 24 miles, so a little longer than my last TBF race. All in all it took closer to two hours to finish, which was fine with me. Anything under an hour and a half is too short.

Overall, I just felt fatigued and only able to put out 85%-90%, which was to be expected. I managed to keep a good amount of effort though, avoided crashing and was able to do what I considered a good race for me.

### What Went Well
Nutrition was good, didn’t cramp, had a lot of fun. I put on the lighter tires for this race, and they worked perfectly.

### What Went Poorly
Number plate distracted me and I got caught in the pack of the pack again. Also, I’ve noticed I have a really hard time getting to my Clif bars through my vest that I wear when it’s cold.

### What I would like to do going forward
I need to be a little more patient with passing the non-expert riders. I passed a rider on the downhill at a spot that they weren’t completely comfortable with and they ended up going over the bars. This is something that’s always a struggle for me with circuit races with everyone on a closed course, because you actually can lose minutes by waiting to pass riders. But, I don't ever want to make someone crash, especially at a "local" race that I'm using mostly for training.

Also, I’m going to rework the cables on my bike to make sure I can secure a number plate better.

### General Remarks/Conclusion
Fun race, pretty standard. Really happy to get some back to back races in early in the season.
