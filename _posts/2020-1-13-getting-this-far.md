It’s been about 2 and a half months since I started training in a more focused manner, and a little over a year since I started bike racing again. If you check out the “[About Me](/about.html)” section of this site you can read a little more about why I’ve been training, but I just wanted to recap more of the logistical timeline of what has got me here. Here’s what the timeline has been like.

### September 2018
After half a decade of being mostly off the bike, I decide that I want to bike race again.
### Winter 2018
I start training harder, with a soft goal to do a stage race in 2019.
## January 2019
I sign up for the [Trans-Sylvania Epic](https://www.tsepicmtb.com/).
### May 2019
I participate in the [Trans-Sylvania Epic](https://www.tsepicmtb.com/) and finish in the top half of the “open” category
### October 2019
I decide to pursue bike racing more wholeheartedly and ask for reduced time at work, starting January. I also decide to target more races and higher positions in races for 2020.
### November 2019
I start working with a cycling coach and training 5-6 days a week
### January 2020
Reduced hours at work start. I have my first race of the season.

In September 2018, in the car ride that I decided to do a stage race and effectively get back into bike racing in general, my friend passed along this nugget of wisdom:
>“Change happens 1% at a time”

I really didn’t want to believe it, I wanted change immediately. In my mind, training for cycling can be such a simple thing: if I put 10-15 hours on the bike a week, I get really strong. I know my body recovers well and responds to training at a pretty above average rate. But in order to be able to do that (and beyond), I had to make so many changes (and still do). 

Ironically, without setting out to, I’ve been making 1% changes in my life for the past 18 months to get this point. I’ve had to make changes to cooking habits, living situations, relationships, social commitments, bedding, work commitments, budgeting habits, and volunteer engagements, and entertainment choices. And a lot of these changes have ended up being counterintuitive to conventional advice or what you “should” do (e.g. spend more and volunteer less).

It’s been a journey, and I’m still just starting.
