## Summary
It was a cold day, and I got to the start line a bit late due to a little confusion about the actual starting time. So, I started in last place but was pretty quickly able to move my up to the front quarter of the pack. From about 7 minutes on to the finish of the race I did not get passed, nor did I pass anyone else in my race to my knowledge.

I felt like I had a strong start on the opening flat section and first climb/descent, but then pretty quickly had difficulty managing my effort. The course at Granite Bay is almost the exact opposite of what I usually ride. I usually ride long climbs (5-60+ minute) and long descents (2-20 minute). The longest climb at this race was under 2 minutes and the longest descent was around 30 seconds. In other words, I’m just more used to sustained efforts and this course didn’t really have any of those.

There was a lot of race traffic for passing, so that did make things a little difficult, but besides that I rode and finished the race without incident.

## What Went Well
I felt like I had a really strong start. I prepared and maintained my bike properly, so it performed without issues. I didn’t fall or crash. I was quick to pass the race traffic but wasn’t rude. I had a really good effort leading into the finish. I wore the right clothes. I didn’t cramp, get thirsty, or hungry. I crushed the downhills and the longer climbs. I had a support crew and they took good care of me. I had a recovery drink ready in the car for afterwards.

## What Went Poorly
I had a bad starting position. I had too beefy of tires on my bike. I didn’t transition in between the short climbs and downhills with consistent power. I forgot my rollers so I had to warm up on a stretch of road instead of by my car.

## What I would like to do going forward
I need to put more XC race oriented tires on my bike. I have some Maxxis Ikon’s, but I think even those might be a little much for this sort of terrain. I’ll bring my rollers to the next race, or maybe even get a trainer. 

## General Remarks/Conclusion
It was a good first race of the year. I ended feeling like I still had more left in me, but it was a short race (82 minutes) so that’s not super surprising. Good training, and a good opener for the year
