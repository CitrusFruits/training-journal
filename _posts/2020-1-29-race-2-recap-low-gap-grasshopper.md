### Summary
Race 2 of the year was the Low Gap Grasshopper. The course was roughly 40 miles, 20 on road and 20 off with about 5600 feet of climbing. The bike of choice was my Motobecane Fantom cyclocross, which ended up being both the perfect tool for the job and my downfall.

As the race started, I felt pretty fantastic in terms of form and was able to make my way up to near the front on the first climb, and was able to stick it out with that group without much struggle for the first half of the race. The course suited me well with long ascents (1500ft +) which matches what I’m typically used to training on in the east bay. However, despite my good form and affinity for the course, the race took a turn for the worse; my bike didn’t want to cooperate.

About a mile into the dirt, which was more like slush and mud, my rear wheel started rubbing. I tried to fix it, but inadvertently broke the seal on the tubeless tire and delayed myself further since I had to to fix the flat as well. As I was fixing the flat I realized none of the spokes on my rear wheel had tension anymore, for whatever reason. I chose to continue riding to try to get home, but the rubbing continued to get worse and I had to stop a couple times to hand tighten the spokes (they were that loose). Needless to say, I lost a lot of time. I managed to ride the broken wheel with slack spokes 20 miles on dirt and finish the race, which all things considering I was more than happy with just getting home in one piece, and had a lot of fun overall.

### What Went Well
My fitness was good and I brought the right bike for the job (except for the mechanical). I paced myself well and had good nutrition going into the race, as well as decent sleep. I also felt as though my bike handling skills on the descents were on the upper end of everyone I was riding with, even near the front.

### What Went Poorly
The mechanical complications were the big downside of this race, which is something I could have handled through better preparation. Las week I was scrambling to get the ‘cross bike race ready and had to replace the rear wheel, which may have had something to do with it. I may have also just ridden the downhill too aggressively and dented the wheel badly. Besides that, I did start to bonk a little towards the end despite eating regularly.

### What I would like to do going forward
Have a more solid option for a cyclocross bike, and get things handled ahead of time. My ‘cross bike was more on the budget end, and it had a hard time keeping up with this race.

Also, I need to reconsider my nutrition for races that go beyond 2.5 hours so that I don’t get close to bonking. Perhaps I need a little more protein in the mix.

### General Remarks/Conclusion
Had a great (but hard) day, loved the course and the feel of the race and will definitely be coming back again.
