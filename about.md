title: About me

Hey there!

My name is Andrew Duensing. I work a software engineering job in the morning, and ride bikes in the afternoons. Everything you read here will be mostly about my journey training for competitive cycling as well as the things I learned along the way. If you're a fellow non-professional training to be a better athlete, I hope that the content here might be useful, interesting, or even entertaining.

You can think of me a little bit like Adonis Creed in the movie Creed. I have a good job and successful professional career, but I can’t just let it be. Now, I haven’t quit my job, but I’m entirely focused on making sure I give competitive cycling everything I got before I age out.

At the time of writing, I’m 27 years old. That may seem young to a lot of people, but in the world of professional athleticism it’s starting to get to the older side of things. But, there hasn’t ever been a better time for me personally to start pursuing this. For the first time in my life, I have the conviction, resources, and stability to really go hard in training and racing in a sustainable manner.

My goal is to beat professional cyclists in races, mostly mountain bike races. I don’t necessarily want to _be_ a professional cyclist, but I want to compete at that level. Right now my two biggest target events are the 2020 Trans-Sylvania Epic in May and the 2020 Downieville Classic in July.

See you out there!

Andrew
